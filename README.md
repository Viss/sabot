This js file is current as of wednesday november 13th, 2024.
instructions for use are quite straightforward:
- get your bearer token (use inspector, in the network tab)
- get your handle (clearly the most challenging step)
- edit the js file in notepad or vi or something to swap in your values
- open twitter (i used firefox for this)
- go to your profile tab/section, so that you are looking at your own profile
- open the inspector
- click on 'console' near the left
- paste the entire (edited) file into the inspector
- hit enter
- watch sparks fly out of the fuckin' thing :D

[edit] - you may have to run this multiple times. from your profile 'tab', it can only see retweets and posts, but not 'replies', those are in another section, so you'll have to click on 'with replies' in your profile and run it again.
